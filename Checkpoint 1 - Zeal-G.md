# Data Analysis Final Project Checkpoint One

## Dataset

I'll be using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/myrios/cost-of-living-index-by-country-by-number-2024/data).

# Task at hand
Exploring the difference in cost of living from country to country and just how much it varies. The business issue at hand; Our client would like to move out of the U.S., but has no idea where to start looking. They are looking for most affordable options, for their lifestyle. They are interested in the cost of living with rent, but prefer going out to restuarants versus grocery shopping. Overall we are looking for the country where the living index accomadates their lifestyle. They do not have a budget, so we will be looking from the most expensive to the most inexpensive Countries for this project.
